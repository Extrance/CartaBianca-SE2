The GET / can be a health check endpoint but is not quite correct for an API to say "display main page of the website":
- Modifica su ApiAry nelle definizioni


Some services do not define Request/Response objects:
- Still apiAry


The exam model seems to miss some properties, for instance where do you store the deadline? how do you relate exams with students and tasks?
- Add deadline
- Push Exam for Assignm
- Only a DOC (different MAT format) can enter the Exams page

The task model doesn't seem to support different type of questions (like multiple choice of free-form) since I do not see a type property or something similar.
- Add coloumn type
- Add coloumn multiSolution
- Add coloumn openField

The answer model seems to be completed.
- Nothing to state here.

The current status of the API doesn't seem to support reviews yet.
- Holy shit I totally forgot
